# summer_2025
This is my project repo for the Summer of 2025. My goal is to complete as many hands-on projects as I can over the summer before the start of the Fall 2025 semester. 

## Electronics
This will include a mix of projects that implement one or more of the following:
1. FPGA ([Basys3](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/start?srsltid=AfmBOoriRJnT5pyysfZDiNzlBGubq7EAhkmAWs0_7EIBbszI7cDF9goc), [Cmod A7-35T](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/cmod-a7/start?srsltid=AfmBOoqoAmC3hf2-nYG11mzGr-OMs1TPkbDlGZtYP659Om2hffFpXdH6))
2. Microcontroller ([STM32F4DISCOVERY](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html), [Arduino Nano 33 IoT](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-iot/))
3. Supercomputer ([Jetson Orin Nano Super Developer Kit](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/nano-super-developer-kit/))
4. Miscellaneous Electronics ([TI-92 Plus](https://www.ticalc.org/basics/calculators/ti-92plus.html))
